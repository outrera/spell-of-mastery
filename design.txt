THIS FILE STATES DESIGN DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE

General:
- The basic idea is to design an X-Com inspired game, but in a fantasy setting, with determenistic game mechanics (i.e. game design doesn't use random dice rolls). Instead of different kind of weapons, that must be researched, Spell of Mastery has different kind of researcheable creatures, serving different roles: melee, bomb throwing, artillery and snipers. The enchancement spells play the role of equipment, say instead of physical armor item, we we have magic shield enchantment, and instead of medkits we have guardian angel enchantment. Further plans would be rethinking X-Com's geoscape for fantasy setting, i.e. kingdom view, where monsters are invading, and instead of base, player has ivory tower for wizard and cities he must protect. Instead of alien encounters. Instead of alien bases, there would be dungeons and ruins to explore.
- Each creature has 5 major stats: Speed, Health, Attack, Defense, Range and Will. Some magical artifacts and structures can affect these numbers.
- Speed represent how many map squares this creature can trave per turn. The more complex is the action the more steps it will require per turn.
- Attack represent how many health points that creature's attack removes from victim.
- Defense represent how many steps it would cost for other creature to attack this one. While it doesn't take much strength to kill a rat, yet rat is a very agile creature, so it takes a lot of speed to hit it and really slow moving creature wont be able to catch a rat at all. At the same time, bat being fast, may bite some unarmored creature and run away.
- Range determines how far this creature can attack.
- Will stat determines how many caster points is required to cast a harmful spell onto this creature, for example, if somebody is trying to cast mind control spell onto your creature you will be notified and will have that creature's number of turns to counter the spell. Although enemy can invest additional mana to prevent countering the spell.
- Usual humanoid speed is 6 steps per turn. Bat's speed is 14 cells/turn;. Leader moves at speed of 5. Casting spell or attacking requires 4 steps. Haste gives +4 steps, allowing most units to attack twice.
- Tier 1 creature costs 5 mana, while ultimate creature, dragon, costs 20.
- Fall damage equals to FallHeight*3-2

Spells:
- Knowledge (neutral): converts mana into lore.
- Dispel (neutral): removes all the following enchantments:
    shell, bless, fear, invisibility, flight, haste.
  This spell can be resisted, in that case it removes only the resistance enchantment. 
- Telekinesis (neutral): grabs key, treasure, mana, gains control over rescueable creature, visits quest places, hurls rocks, pushes creature, or operates an object from a distance. Can't be used at chests.
- Heal (law): target regains 9 health, and gets cured from poison and fear.
- Lightning (chaos): target loses 9 health. Target must be outdoor.
- Haste (law): target gains 2 additional movement points.
- Fear (chaos): target loses ability to act for the next three turns.
- Shell (law): target gains immunity to the next physical attack.
- Resist (chaos): target gains immunity to the next magical attack.
- Bless (law): target gains ability to harm undead and break magic doors.
- Curse (chaos): makes target immune to non-magical weapon, but vulnerable to blessed units.
- Invisibility (law): target becomes invisible, gaining 100% bonus to melee attack [make sure stats info show it]; attacking strips invisibility.
- Firewall (chaos): creates a wall of fire at empty space, damaging creatures entering it. One wall burns for 10 turns, while cooldown is 5 turns, allowing wizard to support two walls at any given time.
- Flight (law): target gains ability to fly.
- Detonate (chaos): controlled creature explodes, dealing damage to all neighbors, equivalent to creature's health.
- Subvert (law): gain control over the target creature by spending mana equivalent to creature's willpower.
- Armageddon (chaos): all units sustain 5 points of damage.
- The Spell of Mastery (neutral): banishes all competing wizards from this plane of existence. Requires overcoming the combined will of all enemy's creatures, of course player is expected to protect this enchancement by channeling additional mana into it.

Digging Mechanics:
- only dirt is diggable.
- player can only dig tile between two other tiles, that will avoid removing support from ceiling and limits player to creating tunnels, instead of caves.
- digging height>>3 dirt wall creates height=2 tunnel, but only if that cell is near height=3 wall.
- digging height=2 wall lowers it, but only if it isn't surrounded by height=3 walls.
- floor can be digged to create height=3 mine schaft with ladder, allowing creature do descend and ascend, if enemy creature blocks path, ascending/descending would attack it.
- digged out dirt could be restored.

Liquid dynamics:
- Water emitter increasing water pressure of its tile: when pressure reaches 5 it either leaks into neiboring tiles, or into the tile above, if water reaches map edge, it goes back into emitter or falls with rain.
- Units standing in waster with height higher or equal to ther gets drowned, unless they have swimming ability.
