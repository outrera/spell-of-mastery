- Show all learnable spells, so player can learn requirements for getting them.
- Allow any wizard to summon any creature.
- Introduce tabs for different spell types.
- Include recall to pentagram into AI's pathfinding.
- height advantage gives +1 to attack
- refactor some uses of add_effect into add_param
  should not use Params for effect's script
- rename moves to on_move, etc..
- Think about refactoring genes to use ECS system, where each unit has a list of systems acting on him. Like i.e. poison system and regen systems.
- AI should change vampire into bat form, before attack, and then back to vampire, when he is sees enemy and can attack
- store map events in a separate file
- 1-way portals, leading to situations where enemy can quickly attack player, while player has to find other way.
- doors, which could be constructed by dwarf or some other creatures
- traps
- Summoning tab should be seen only when leader is selected.

Mage's units:
blob (cheap but timed and slow summon, defends pentagram from occupation by invader)
oculus (flyer, used to cast spells far away from wizard and draw portal exit nodes, also acts as siege weaponry by casting long range spells)
beetle (cheap, low attack, but sturdy unit for occupying magic nodes)
halfling (becomes invisible, which gives bonus to attack [make sure it is displated at stats])
elf (shooter and healer)
dwarf (digs terrain, similarly to imp)
ifrit (flyer, fire shield damages attackers, can throw fireballs)
minotaur (heavy hitter, but slow)
hydra (attacks in all four directions, regenerates out of power node)
dragon (explodes on death, damaging all nearby creatures)

All undead units regenerate out of power node.

Design:
- Weapons and other items, that boost carrying creature's stats. Make sure only creatures with hands could use, say, swords. Or limit artifacts only to specific creatures, like humanoids. For examle, there can be an artifact, that grans additional mana per turn to the holder.
- Throwing items.
- AI should cast spell of mastery, when his lossage gets too high
- When one players starts casting spell of mastery, all other players will get notified, so they get a chance to stop caster by allied assault.
- reintroduce sokoban boxes pushing, lifting, falling and floating on water; units standing on top of moved objects should move with them
- when unit drops large item, like crate, it pops under that unit, serving as elevation
- phone/touch version should have transparent buttons
- non-leader units could be able to hide inside bushes
- AI autolocks doors when enemies are nearby and open them, to allow its units to pass
- Destructible trees. By attacking and destroying trees, some creatures could clear way to some goodies or other strategic advantage.
- Day-night cycle, making some creatures stronger, and other weaker.
- Allow savegame only when certain amount of turns have passed since the last load. Each save also increases the number of turns, player has to play between successive saves, that will discourage save scumming.
- X-com style cone FOV, opening a lot of strategic possibilities, like allowing surprise attack from back.
- Global map, where player can find next destination. Collected spells are preserved between maps.
- Steeds: horse, lizard and gryphon; For start, the rider can simply be drawn near his mount's sprite.
  Mount can't attack, while being rided and all actions are the actions of the rider. Rider can unmount into any of the four directions. All incoming damage goes to the mount.
- second (rare) resource like souls or gems, required to summon powerful creatures.
  Maybe only wizard can collect it.
- Pickupable treasures, giving lore.
- Some spells may require special objects. Destroying such object will deprive the wizard of the spells provided by it. Some objects can provide constant abilities or show whole map (i.e. palantir).
- potion brewing, using cauldron and ingredients, collected from map.
- rescueable creatures, depicted with barred cage cell over them.
- colored keys and colored doors and chests these keys open.
- different types of terrain affecting movement speed.

Creatures:
- Observer could be able to cast all spells, just like oculus.
- Oculus could serve as detector of invisible units and maybe an invisible spy itself
- A unit that uses enemy's attack strength intstead of its own.
- A creature that can block, instead of moving or attacking. Blocking reduces any damage to 1.
- Elemental weakness. I.e. slimes being weak to fire
- Some creatures acting as healers. Yet healers should only be able to heal directly adjanced units.


Spells:
- Pentagram: creates a portal, to which any controlled unit can be summoned. Enemy units remove it on entering.
- Generators: creates a place spawning monsters. Implement generators as a platform, that clones the monster standing on top of it. Player can remove it by moving its own unit on top of it. Unit standing on top of generator will have one additional action: clone, but its cooldown time should be assigned to generator. Higher level monsters will induce higher cooldown. Clones of neautral monsters will then roam the map.
- Guardian: summons a tower at empty space near caster. The tower can attack nearby enemies
- Reveal Spells: remove fog of war at places where spells are located.
- Panacea: heals all friendly unit by 4 point of damage.
- Haste: caster units can move one additional cell per turn.
- Slow: enemy units move one cell slower.
- Shell: caster units are immune to next attack.
- Bloodlust: caster units now do +1 damage
- Invisibility: caster units become invisible.
- Dispel: removes all magic effects from target creature, including beneficial.
- Turn into Undead: target loses ability to regenerate, yet gains immunity from non-echanted weapons. All undeads have enchanted weapons.
- Enchant: target gains ability to harm undead.
- Paralyze/Fear/Time-Stop: enemy units lose next turn.
- Firewall: make all you units leave fire trail behind them
- Duel: create 3x3 arena in the center of map, where all 4 wizards get summoned.
- Chaos: shuffling (non-leader?) units inside of some range
- Gooey Blob: slowly covers entire map in agressive blob, unless fought
- Detonate: controlled creaute explodes, dealing damage to all neighbors, proportional to creatures health.
- Magic Block: a spell blocking all sides from using mana-consuming actions for a short time.
- Counter Magic: the next enemy spell fails
- Drought: temporary removes all water, replacing it with special empty aux tile
- Teleport: move unit to any seen location.
- Harm Mirror: reflects damage from the next attack back to attacker.
- Earthquake: damage non-flyers.
- Toxic Gas: damages indoor units.
- Walk on Water: allows unit to walk over water.
- Terraforming spells: raise/lower elevation, create/remove water pool, etc...
- Astral Attack: caster spends N mana to make target wizard lose N*2.
- Time Travel: caster first creates a snapshot, to which it can return from the future, but only single time. Make sure cooldown time of the spell won't be carried back with the caster.
- spells that do both good/bad to you and your enemy.
- Regeneration: grant regeneration ability to all caster's units, when no enemies are attacking them.
- Visions: see through the fog of war
- Fly: allows target to fly
- Descend/Ascend: move unit between layers.
- Almagest: switches day to night and night to day
- Subvert: gain control over the target.
- Spy: wizard learns the next unknown spell, casted by any wizard.
- Invisibility: caster units become invisible
- Clone Self: creates clone of self, which will continue leading, if creator dies
- Morph: turn caster into a monster of his choice, until his next move
- The Spell of Mastery: banishes all competing wizards from this plane of existence
  Requires having 2-more magic nodes than any of competing wizards and maintaining this difference for the next 10 moves
- Armageddon: reduces all creatures down to 1 health.
- Open Node: tears the fabric of reality to open new magic node, which should be placed 4 hexes away from an existing node
- Close Node: closes existing magic node


Graphics:
- New player colors: player{blue},king{purple},warlock{black},witch{red},
                     katzard{green},mime{orange},neutral{white}
- beetle movement frame gets cropped;
- beetle needs attack animation;
- dragon animation jumps horizontally during attack
- finish house tileset, including floor and roof; dirt/plain should not align to house wall
- better flight animation (idle and cloud under unit); use wesnoth halo/saurian-magic-halo-*; monster-elemental_air could be useful too
- better hasted unit animation (trail after hasted creature)
- power node should have round bottom, so it would look more natural on rough terrain or in flight.
- Better stones tileset. Current one don't really fit in.
- Automate shadow placement
- road object, which would block grass
- grass corner sprites, which would be auto placed onto dirt in corners between two grass tiles.
- design fullscreen graphics effects, like armageddon, snowstorm, fog and nighttime.
- dummy units, that would be left instead of real one, when fog of war takes place
- fog of war reveal animation
- particle system
- New tilesets: Snow, Lava, Swamp


UI:
- add some description to tabs and menu tabs buttons
- unit profile and main menu options could be a tabs like all others
- monster sound acks
- ui/Tempest_In_The_Aether_Interface_and_Ryzom_Core has potentially usable icons
- a line from the portrait of current unit to its location on minimap
- better health indicators for selected units (use green dots - one per hit-point)
- in editor, placing unit on top of object should not be possible.
- simple way to temporarily transfer control to the AI, for map and AI testing.



Symta Language Handicaps:
- no way to quickly introduce an inplace field on a struct, like unit, propagating it to save-file.


Bugs:
- vampire on low health turning into bat results in bat being invincible with 0 health (enemies cant attack it)
- fix sound issues, where sounds are affected by height
- when new map gets saved, folder browser should update content
- when height>>80, column tiles and units are not drawn
- hydra damages and poisons allied units
- invisibility doesnt hide poison, bood and regen effects
- flying units can possibly crash pathfinder, when they are at very high tiles, being able to cross border. Insert a check against mad dimensions.
- blizzard projectiles have no gravity
- player can research enemy units
- adding and removing table from corner crashes the game, due to attempt to place outside of the map
- multicell units, like table, react badly when drawing tiles under them. disallow drawing at all
- `update_picked` and unit.picked should use different picking strucutre. current is error prone and had led to bugs previously
- projectiles hung up, when their sender dies


Graphics Editing Hints:
- Grayscale layer can be used with "Darken" to change tile brightness.
- "Overlay" blending mode can be used to colorize grayscale image
- Removing transparency:
   1) Load Transparency Mask as Selection  (While pressing the Cmd key {Ctrl Key on PC} "click on" the image icon for this Layer in the Layers Panel
   2) Create Layer Mask from the Selection using Reveal Selection (Layer > Layer Mask > Reveal Selection)
   3) Display B&W Layer Mask  (While pressing the Option Key {Alt Key on PC} "click on" the layer mask icon for this Layer in the Layers Panel)
   4) Image > Adjustments > Threshold  with Threshold set to 255
- to split image into tiles: convert input.png -crop 64x64 +repage 3-idle%d.png
- to add missing digits: for i in *.png; do sename "\([^0-9]\)\([0-9]\)\.png" "0\0\1.png" $i; done

Optimization Possibilities:
- use cell index directly instead of unit_goal wrapper
- when all four corners of object sprite are hidden, don't allow selecting it, also, dont draw it. requires probing pixels inside framebuffer
- fast way to determine height to the ceiling - that way we can have large creature wont be able to move into tiny hole. One way to do it is by using special tiles in place of empty or void tiles
- obstacles blocking sight, would require precomputed sight tree, where one blocked node would block sight to all children.
- when updating tiles, we can also mark doorways, so that flyers and jumpers could pick between multiple Z-levels
- mouse picking can be done in reverse on draw list

Types of Creature Movement:
- Walker
- Flyer
- Swimmer (can walk over water)
- Climber (can scale walls)
- Incorporeal (Walk through doors and 1-tile walls) can be implemented using teleport spell



- Collectible spells, like weapons in Doom. That will greatly simplify gameplay and force wizard to explore world for new spells quickly, instead of turtling. It is also possible, that some spell be present in a single quantity, so only one wizard will ever obtain it. Spells could be presented at shrines, guarded by creatures. Only wizard can learn from such shrines. Maybe visiting shrine gives only a limited number of spellcasting. Optionally, there could be a way to steal enemy spells and a method that forces enemy to forget chosen spells.
  Pros:
    - lore gets eliminated;
    - exploration becomes fun;
    - easier to control what spells are available to player;
    - no annoying research dialogue;
    - map design get more involved, where player can get dragon since beginning;
  Cons:
    - start could be boring;
    - wizards lose specialization;
    - collectible spells could still be provided;
    - loss of strategic depth;
    - explorating can be encouraged through collecting map treasures, giving lore.
    - requires map designer to place all spells somewhere;
    - creating an icon system;
    - multiplayer maps would probably require to include some spells several times;
