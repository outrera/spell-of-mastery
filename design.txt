THIS FILE STATES DESIGN DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE

General:
- The basic idea is to design an X-Com inspired game, but in a fantasy setting, with determenistic game mechanics (i.e. game design doesn't use random dice rolls). Instead of different kind of weapons, that must be researched, Spell of Mastery has different kind of researcheable creatures, serving different roles: melee, bomb throwing, artillery and snipers. The enchantment spells play the role of equipment, say instead of physical armor item, we we have magic shield enchantment, and instead of medkits we have guardian angel enchantment. Further plans would be rethinking X-Com's geoscape for fantasy setting, i.e. kingdom view, where monsters are invading, and instead of base, player has ivory tower for wizard and cities he must protect. Instead of alien encounters or alien bases, there would be dungeons and ruins to explore. Additionally zeppelins, flying ships, flying islands/castles could be introduced for transporting squad on kingdom view.
- Each creature has 5 major stats: Moves, Health, Attack, Defense, View, Range, and Will. Some magical artifacts and structures can affect these numbers.
- Moves determines how many movement point or steps this unit gains per turn. One move allows moving one map square. The more complex is the action the more moves it will require per turn.
- Health determines how much damage that unit could take, before perishing.
- Attack determines how many health points that creature's attack removes from victim on its usual attack.
- Defense determines how many moves it would cost for other creature to attack this one. While it doesn't take much strength to kill a rat, yet rat is a very agile creature, so it takes a lot of speed to hit it and really slow moving creature wont be able to catch a rat at all. At the same time, bat being fast, may bite some unarmored creature and run away. Player may pick against which attacker his creature should concentrate its defense for the next turn, ignoring attacks from other ones. Lost defense points are regenerated at the end of a turn, if creature is not engaged, based on remaining movement points. A creature that successfuly defended can counter-attack, if it has some movement points.
- Sight determines how far this unit sees.
- Range determines how far this creature can attack. Not that for artillery units range is usually longer than their sight.
- Will stat determines how much mana that creature can channel into its spellcasting per turn and ho much additional mana it will cost to cast harmful enchantment onto this creature. For example, if somebody is trying to cast subvert spell onto a creature, he will have to spent subvert's spell cost plus that creature's will power.
- Typial humanoid has 6 moves per turn. Bat's speed is 14 cells/turn;. Leader moves at speed of 5, preventing leader to be able to run away from most creatures. Casting spell or attacking requires 4 moves. Haste gives +4 moves, allowing most units to attack twice.
- Tier 1 creature costs 5 mana, while ultimate creature, dragon, costs 20.
- Fall damage equals to FallHeight*3-2

Spells:
- Knowledge (neutral): converts mana into lore.
- Dispel (neutral): removes all the following enchantments:
    shell, bless, fear, invisibility, flight, haste.
  This spell can be resisted, in that case it removes only the resistance enchantment. 
- Telekinesis (neutral): grabs key, treasure, mana, gains control over rescueable creature, visits quest places, hurls rocks, pushes creature, or operates an object from a distance. Can't be used at chests.
- Heal (law): target regains 9 health, and gets cured from poison and fear.
- Lightning (chaos): target loses 9 health. Target must be outdoor.
- Haste (law): target gains 2 additional movement points.
- Fear (chaos): target loses ability to act for the next three turns.
- Shell (law): target gains immunity to the next physical attack.
- Resist (chaos): target gains immunity to the next magical attack.
- Bless (law): target gains ability to harm undead and break magic doors.
- Curse (chaos): makes target immune to non-magical weapon, but vulnerable to blessed units.
- Invisibility (law): target becomes invisible. Doing any action beside movement would cancel invisibility.
- Firewall (chaos): creates a wall of fire at empty space, damaging creatures entering it. One wall burns for 10 turns, while cooldown is 5 turns, allowing wizard to support two walls at any given time.
- Flight (law): target gains ability to fly.
- Detonate (chaos): controlled creature explodes, dealing damage to all neighbors, equivalent to creature's health.
- Subvert (law): gain control over the target creature by spending mana equivalent to creature's willpower.
- Armageddon (chaos): all units sustain 5 points of damage.
- The Spell of Mastery (neutral): banishes all competing wizards from this plane of existence. Requires overcoming the combined will of all enemy's creatures, of course player is expected to protect this enchantment by channeling additional mana into it.

Creature Properties:
- Leader: this creature is a leader. If it dies and its owner has no other leaders, then its owner loses.
- Engaged: this creature is engaged into a fight with enemy, and cannot move further or retreat this turn. Creature gets this status by doing any action near an non-afraid enemy, like moving into adjanced cell, or ending its turn in a cell near an enemy. Allied units can still swap places with engaged unit, takin its place.
- Threatened: this creature has started its turn near enemy, if at the end of its first action it remains threatened, it becomes engaged.
- Charging: creature is charging its spell or performing other action. While creature is busy charging, its only abilities would be casting the charged spell or canceling the process. If creature gets harmed during a charge, its spellcasting fails and all charged mana is returned back to mana reserves. Charging specific abilities would immobilize the creature, in other cases it may be possible to have a precharged spell or action.

- Sinner: creature has spilled blood by killing somebody. Such creatures are vulneraly to specific abilities, like devil's punish ability.
- Heavy: cannot be lifted into air by tornado, telekinesis, flight spell or dragon wings blow.

Digging Mechanics:
- only dirt is diggable.
- player can only dig tile between two other tiles, that will avoid removing support from ceiling and limits player to creating tunnels, instead of caves.
- digging height>>3 dirt wall creates height=2 tunnel, but only if that cell is near height=3 wall.
- digging height=2 wall lowers it, but only if it isn't surrounded by height=3 walls.
- floor can be digged to create height=3 mine schaft with ladder, allowing creature do descend and ascend, if enemy creature blocks path, ascending/descending would attack it.
- digged out dirt could be restored.

Liquid dynamics:
- Water emitter increasing water pressure of its tile: when pressure reaches 5 it either leaks into neiboring tiles, or into the tile above, if water reaches map edge, it goes back into emitter or falls with rain.
- Units standing in waster with height higher or equal to ther gets drowned, unless they have swimming ability.
