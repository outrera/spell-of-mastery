Digging Mechanics:
- only dirt is diggable.
- digging height>>3 dirt wall creates height=2 tunnel, but only if that cell is near height=3 wall. Obviously, one cannot dig under water.
- digging height=2 wall lowers it, but only if it isn't surrounded by height=3 walls.
- floor can be digged to create height=3 mine schaft with ladder, allowing unit do descend and ascend, if enemy unit blocks path, ascending/descending would attack it.
- digged out dirt could be restored.
