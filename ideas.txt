THIS FILE STATES DESIGN POSSIBILITIES

Leader abilities:
- Dual-cast: allows casting two different spells on two different locations on the same turn.

General:
- Different units could have different will regeneration rates.
- Consider spells, that inflict damage based on unit's will depletion.
- Consider units at zero or negative will receiving additional damage.
- Attacking some units may also require spending will or breaking their will.
- Alternative resource system: limiting mana hoarding, proportional to the number of silos crystals, player built. Say leader starts with 10 storage, each crystal provides 5 additional mana storage. Crystals are required to cast high-cost spells. Silos could be also allowed to slowly move.
  Pros:
     - nice growth limiting
     - if leader's health is linked to mana, then destroying crystals would weaken that leader
     - could serve as creature population limiter, encouraging using less creatures. Say each creature takes 1 storage limit, to keep its sould bound. Note that storage limit shouldn't fall to less than the requirement to summon crystal.
     - provides tactical ways to saboutage opponent's mana reserves by destroying crystals.
  Cons:
    - Spawning a crystal would waste precious leader's turn, that could be spent on something cooler.
    - Could be too complex for AI to handle.
- Elevator tiles.
- Reagents used to reduce spellcasting cost, in a way that mana cost first subtracted from reagent pools. Alternatively, spells could specify reagents, that they can consume instead of mana. Simpler system would have just one reagent, say shrooms, that could be purchased with mana, and that reagent would be required to cast most powerful spells, or to pay upkeep. Cauldron could be required to make use of reagents, generate them, or it can provide separate boost. Liquid color in cauldron would indicate it's owner.
- Non flyers should be able to jump from a cliff, sustaining fall damage
- Allow some flyers/climbers to throw down unit standing near cliff, echangin place with it and inducing fall damage.
- Power-up structures or units: for example. a structure/unit decreasing cooldown, boosting experience gain or increasing damage from units or spells.
- Consider idea of unit's facing direction affecting its vision through FOW and turning would require spending steps. X-com style cone FOV, opening a lot of strategic possibilities, like allowing surprise attack from back.
- Distance from caster affecting spell cost, so casting at nearby targets would cost the least.
- A way to cast spell, like shell or heal, on all units for additional mana. Have a separate tab for that.
- Generators: a place spawning monsters. Implement generators as a platform, that clones the monster standing on top of it. Player can remove it by moving its own unit on top of it. Unit standing on top of generator will have one additional action: clone, but its cooldown time should be assigned to generator. Higher level monsters will induce higher cooldown. Clones of neautral monsters will then roam the map.
- Pickupable treasures, giving lore. I.e. wizard can buy books and access to knowledge.
- Weapons and other items, that boost carrying creature's stats. Make sure only creatures with hands could use, say, swords. Or limit artifacts only to specific creatures, like humanoids. For examle, there can be an artifact, that grans additional mana per turn to the holder.
- Throwing items.
- Units and spells gaining terrain bonuses.
- AI should cast spell of mastery, when his lossage gets too high
- When one players starts casting spell of mastery, all other players will get notified, so they get a chance to stop caster by allied assault.
- reintroduce sokoban boxes pushing, lifting, falling and floating on water; units standing on top of moved objects should move with them
- when unit drops large item, like crate, it pops under that unit, serving as elevation
- phone/touch version should have transparent buttons
- non-leader units could be able to hide inside bushes
- AI autolocks doors when enemies are nearby and open them, to allow its units to pass
- Destructible trees. By attacking and destroying trees, some creatures could clear way to some goodies or other strategic advantage.
- Day-night cycle, affecting creature sight. Non-undead creatures have 1/2 reduced vision during night. One turn would be equivalent to 1 hour. Total Eclipse spell, turning day into night for the next 16 turns. Light spell mitigates effect of darkness. Same way, inside dungeons sight would be reduced. Day-time lowers cost of law spells and increases cost of chaos spells, while night lowers chaos spells' cost, twilight has no bonus. Use dial like WC3 for UI representation of time.
- Allow savegame only when certain amount of turns have passed since the last load. Each save also increases the number of turns, player has to play between successive saves, that will discourage save scumming.
- Global map, where player can find next destination. Collected spells are preserved between maps.
- Steeds: horse, lizard and gryphon; For start, the rider can simply be drawn near his mount's sprite.
  Mount can't attack, while being rided and all actions are the actions of the rider. Rider can unmount into any of the four directions. All incoming damage goes to the mount.
- second (rare) resource like souls or gems, required to summon powerful creatures.
  Maybe only wizard can collect it.
- potion brewing, using cauldron and ingredients, collected from map.
- A quest-giving place, where wizard can get some trivial quest, like killing specific monster or finding some artifact.
- Structures or artifacts that allow casting additional spells per turn.
- rescueable creatures, depicted with barred cage cell over them.
- colored keys and colored doors and chests these keys open.
- switches, opening doors or unleashing monsters.
- different types of terrain affecting movement speed.
- Winter tileset, where creatures without protection from cold, get damage each turn. Add a spell like warmth or endure cold to counter that.
- Hidden doors, that only creatures with detect illusion could see.
- Map places where creature are immune from magical damage.
- Spending lore or building structures to improve wizard: increasing HP, lowering spell cost, boosting mana generation, reducing cooldown, casting more spells per turn.
- A way to boost magic income, like building a node. I.e. by building a special mana-accumulating structure.
- A cauldron would allow converting reagents into mana.
- Bluffing: summoning cheaper, illusionary, version of a creature, that can be banished with disbelieve. Have separate tab for that. Summoning illusion shouldn't require researching that creature.
- Supply lines, breaking which would weaken the opponent.
- Dynamic balance: casting chaos spell increases cost of order spells by 1, then casting order spell would restore the cost, and vice versa. A neutral spell to restore balance.
- Power versions of spells (damage boosted or all targets) should require additional rare mana/catalyst.
- units may be set to act out of turn at the expense of being able to act in their own turn
- Ranged units providing fire support, when standing near defending unit.
- Harmed creatures getting penalties to their attack, defense regen and steps.

Creatures:
- Creature that does damage based on range to the target.
- Creature that is immune to ranged attacks.
- Creature that is immune to blessed attacks.
- Blessed creatures dealing additional damage to undeads. So it would make sense to bless even the creatures with magical attack.
- Creature whose attack is proportional to its defense
- Creature whose attack is proportional to its life
- Creature that can change places with nearby enemy
- Creature, that gives bonuses to nearby allies.
- Creature that does damage based on defenders movement rate.
- Creature that has defense base on its remaining steps: unused movement points reduce damage.
- A unit that uses enemy's attack strength instead of its own.
- Creature ability doing damage TargetMaxHp-TargetCurHp
- A creature with ability to reduce target's health by 50%
- Creature whose strength is proportional to owner's mana.
- Creature whose health is linked to owner's mana. It would also drain reagen's of its type, if they are available.
- Creature abilities that trigger when unit is in critical state
- Reaction abilities, like counter-attack
- A creature ability to pass through solid objects and enemies, but only if their movement ends in an empty cell.
- Creatures that prevents enemies from running away, forcing them to stay near the creature with such ability.
- A creature that is permanently invisible, unless under the sight of oculus.
- Creature alignments: either chaotic, lawful or neutral. Then some creatures can deal additional damage to some alignments.
- Elemental weakness. I.e. slimes being weak to fire

- Time Stop: enemy loses its turn.
- Torando/Whirlwind: nearby units are pushed away from tornado, similarly to dragon's blow away
- Morph (law): caster is morphed into the target creature, that is present on map and seen, until caster cancels effect (need some way to preserve casters original health).
- Equilibrium (law): target creature gets damage proportional to the total creatures its owner has, minus total creatures caster owns. Consider including tiers, so player won't be punished for using low-tier creatures. This spell is one way to break positive feedback.
- Reveal Spells/Items: shows on minimap places where items are located.
- Slow (chaos): target unit moves at half of its speed.
- Teleport: allows teleporting any creature to any visible location.

- Duel: create 3x3 arena in the center of map, where all 4 wizards get summoned.
- Chaos: shuffling (non-leader?) units inside of some range. Any implementation appears to be too random for my game design direction.
- Fire: alternative to firewall: a wave of fire would move across the land, burning grass and trees, but stoping at cliffs. Only the first row of trees should burn out, preventing single fire from shaving whole forest.
- Exchange: swaps target and caster.
- Area of effect spell (should it only affect enemies?).
- Chain lightning, going from target to all units in the range of 3 cells.
- Gooey Blob: slowly covers entire map in agressive blob, unless fought.

- Anchor: blocks target from teleporation.
- Lock Abilities: target is unable to use its special abilities.
- Astral Attack: caster spends N mana to force target wizard lose N*2.
- Time Travel: caster first creates a snapshot, to which it can return from the future, but only single time. Make sure cooldown time of the spell won't be carried back with the caster.
- Time Travel 2: return target to the cell which it occupied at the start of its previous turn.
- Halt: target can't move, but can attack for the next turn.
- Bind/Chain: target's movement and cations get restricted to some area. Alternatively bind target to some object, so that target can only move towards that object.
- Berserk (chaos): increases target's attack, but decreases its health.
- Bloodlust (chaos): target unit gains +1 damage
- Protection (law): target unit gains +1 defense
- Disease: unit contaminates other units, getting 2-cells near him, forcing owner to desperse the forces. Undead units would still contract disease, but get no damage from it.
- Entangle: Target is unable to move, but still can attack.
- Pacify: decreases target's attack, but increases its defense.
- Scrying/Tag: once cast on enemy creature, player can track it and see area around it.

- Spells that do both good/bad to you and your enemy.
- Regeneration: target starts regenerating even outside of power node.
- Vulnerability: decreases target's armor to 0
- Mist: engulfs cell in fog, so only units near it can see what is inside. No magic can target fog cells. Fog cells also slow movement.
- Torment (chaos): halves targets's health.
- Slay: targets receives damage equal to half of its max health. Also consumes part of caster's health, proportional to target's health.
- Kill: kills target, that has less than half HP
- Exorcise: a cheap spell that damages cursed units, but has no effect on uncursed units. Damage output is similar to lightning. Should kill most weak undeads outright.

- Descend/Ascend: move unit between layers.
- Stalker: homing projectile, that wanders with time towards target enemy, hitting anyone standing on the way.
- Almagest: switches day to night and night to day; Kalispera - sets time to evening; Kalimera - sets time to day.
- Open Node: tears the fabric of reality to open new magic node, which should be placed several cells away from an existing node, to promote territorial control.
- Close Node: closes existing magic node.
- Altar: non undead fallen creatures get resurrected as undeads here, as long as wizard stands near this structure.
- Vampirism: gives unit vampire's abilities.
- Palantir: wizard creates a scrying ball, keeping a creature near ball allows player to see through the fog of war. Yet it doesn't explore the map and doesn't reveal invisible creatures. Also provide some cover structures to counter it, maybe disallow indoors scrying to promote creation of tunnels and buildings by players.

- Return Harm: any damage target deals gets returned to it.
- Sacrifice: creature dies and its health is transfered to heal another.
- Amnesia: target leader forgets target spell.

- Chain: links two units together, so that one cannot move too far from another.
- Leash: links unit to some map place, so he will be unable to move too far from it.


Unused Creatures:
Beetle:
Halfling:
Farmer:
Horse: fast, steed, can be captured on map


- Collectible spells, like weapons in Doom. That will greatly simplify gameplay and force wizard to explore world for new spells quickly, instead of turtling. It is also possible, that some spell be present in a single quantity, so only one wizard will ever obtain it. Spells could be presented at shrines, guarded by creatures. Only wizard can learn from such shrines. Maybe visiting shrine gives only a limited number of spellcasting. Optionally, there could be a way to steal enemy spells and a method that forces enemy to forget chosen spells.
  Pros:
    - lore gets eliminated;
    - exploration becomes fun;
    - easier to control what spells are available to player;
    - no annoying research dialogue;
    - map design get more involved, where player can get dragon since beginning;
  Cons:
    - similar effect could be achieved using reagents and reagent generators, providing cheaper casting for specific spells.
    - start could be boring;
    - wizards lose specialization;
    - collectible spells could still be provided;
    - loss of strategic depth;
    - explorating can be encouraged through collecting map treasures, giving lore.
    - requires map designer to place all spells somewhere;
    - creating an icon system;
    - multiplayer maps would probably require to include some spells several times;

Regarding bigger mana/health/damage numbers:
- Huge health/damage values will make it harder for player to decide outcome.
- Using larger values can indeed help balancing some unit aspects, like health regeneration or poison. On the other hand, slowing down health regeneration can be implemnted differently and most units already have acceptable rates.
- Huge mana income (hundreds per turn) is not required either, because spells could be balanced by their cooldown (or by introducing casting time) and distance-based spell could simply be rounded (i.e. each 5 cells cost additional 1 mana).
- Even with huge numbers, units should still kill other units in a discrete number of hits (i.e. ratman would kill other ratman in 3 hits, while tier=2 fighter would kill ratman in 2 hits)


Regarding experience coming from casting spells or other actions:
  Pros:
    - solves last-hitting problem, when several players or units are competing for experience.
  Cons:
    - discourages exploration and hunting monsters.
    - encourages player using stupid grinding actions each turn, like healing the enemy and attacking it again.

- Regarding mana producing structures or say 10 accumulated mana providing 1/mana per turn.
  Pros:
    -
  Cons:
    - Discourages exploration.
    - Discourages territory countrol.
    - Makes it hard to truly limit player's income.


Linking leader's health to it's mana, so that any damage to the leader first subtracts from the mana:
- A leader that got damanged receives no mana that turn, to prevent health refilling quicker than leader spends it.
- Could be implemented as a spell instead, which would provide a lot more tactical nuances, including ability to dispel it, as well as some creatures getting support from the mana pool.


Flight mode for flying units, where they are immune to land unit attack and can fly over land units:
  Pros:
    - Additional tactical and strategic dimensions, so that only flyers could counter flyers and flyers could pass over non-flying defenders.
    - Bomber unit types, that are very good against ground units, but weak against flyers and ranged attackers.
    - Would make ranged units much more useful.
  Cons:
    - Requires rethinking pathfinding.
    - Hard for AI to handle.
  Posibilities:
    - Flight units could attack from above unit standing below it, or other fliers near it.

Regarding possibility of allowing creature standing on top of another, and the arising complications:
- If creature below starts moving, should the creature on top of it move too? If yes, then should it spend its move points? What if more creatures are standing on top?
- How creature selection would be handled? Some way of z-axis would be needed.
- How attacking or swapping would be processed? It opens some tactical possibilities, like some creatures could have weaknesses when attacked from above.
- One creature could fill gaps and serve as a bridge for another.
- How would AI handle such possibilities?
- Maybe only specific creatures, with acrobatics gene could do that? But then we already have climbers.

Regarding possibility of swapping places with engaged unit:
Pros:
   - More tactical depth, encouraging supporting units.
   - Easier for AI to handle.
Cons:
   - It could potentially lead to infinite loops, where both sides have two creatures and swap them to restore armor.


Regarding attack of opportunity, when enemy enters the range, if defender has enough action points:
Pros:
   - Improves tactical depth
Cons:
   - Simple implementation would give too much advantage to defending site, using ranged units.

Subvert spell can be implemented differently:
    - Each creature has its own subvert cost, called "will". Some creature are immune to subvert. This will may be equivalent to creature's cost.
    - Limit subversion time (i.e. just N turns). make sure player can't disband it.
    - paralyze the caster, while he/she controls the creature, allowing only the "Relinquish Control" action.
    - Limit only to low level creatures.
  Subvert cost seems the easiest to implement and balance. So the best approach would be combining 


Approaches to defense stat implementation:
- Just damage reduction:
    Pros:
      - simple
    Cons:
      - unrealistic and boring - everyone does it.
      - its results can be provided with higher health, regeneration and genes instead.
      - complicates game mechanics
- To-hit chance: nice, but we don't use random numbers, which are known to annoy players.
- To-hit effort: the bigger defense the more effort is required to overcome it. Similar to chance-based approach, but predictable and accumulates nicely: when several units can join the effort, - each unit would contribute to cumulative damage to defense, which regenerates when victim stops being engaged. That way even if unit has not enough moves to hit target this turn, it would still be able to hit it next turn. Also allows a lot of tactical possibilities for several units attack coordination.

Liquid dynamics:
- Water level: really simple to implement, but doesnt give much control and looks static. Not space for cool spells, although increasing level could be used to kill all creatures at the smae level or blocking opponent from certain spaces.
- Water emitter increasing water pressure of its tile: when pressure reaches 5 it either leaks into neiboring tiles, or into the tile above, if water reaches map edge, it goes back into emitter or falls with rain. Allows everything water level allows, gives much more granular control. Allows for more robust spells, that would generate emitter. Allows for running water and flooding caves by digging into aquafier.
- Regarding terraforming spells, like flood: 
  - Allowing player to flood any dirt cell, would allow him to kill any land
    unit, including leader. Therefore flooding occupied cells should be
    disallowed.
  - Flooding could fill with water some cavity, beside places occupied by
    units. The cost of filling would be proportional to cavity size:
    1 cell = 1 mana.
  - Flooding could be global, expanding all water cells
- Populous 3 had cool spell, called bridge, that connected two terrain points. Although such spell would involve generation of new matter.
